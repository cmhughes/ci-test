Demonstration: before and after
===============================

Let’s give a demonstration of some before and after code – after all,
you probably won’t want to try the script if you don’t much like the
results. You might also like to watch the video demonstration I made on
youtube :raw-latex:`\cite{cmh:videodemo}`

As you look at , remember that ``latexindent.pl`` is just following its
rules, and there is nothing particular about these code snippets. All of
the rules can be modified so that you can personalize your indentation
scheme.

In each of the samples given in the ‘before’ case is a ‘worst case
scenario’ with no effort to make indentation. The ‘after’ result would
be the same, regardless of the leading white space at the beginning of
each line which is stripped by ``latexindent.pl`` (unless a
``verbatim``-like environment or ``noIndentBlock`` is specified – more
on this in [sec:defuseloc]).
